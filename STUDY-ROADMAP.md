## 📝 Study Tips

### Understanding vs Memorization
- **Understand WHY** services exist
- **Understand WHEN** to use each service
- **Understand HOW** services integrate
- Don't just memorize feature lists

### Service Comparisons
Create comparison tables for:
- EC2 vs Lambda vs Fargate
- RDS vs DynamoDB vs Aurora
- S3 vs EBS vs EFS
- ALB vs NLB vs GWLB
- CloudWatch vs CloudTrail vs Config

### Common Patterns Recognition
- **High Availability** = Multi-AZ + Auto Scaling + ELB
- **Cost Optimization** = Spot/Reserved + Auto Scaling + Lifecycle
- **Security** = Encryption + Private Subnets + IAM Roles
- **Performance** = Caching + Read Replicas + CDN

---

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice Priorities

### Must-Do Labs
1. **Create VPC** with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway, IGW
2. **Launch EC2** with Auto Scaling and ALB
3. **Configure RDS** Multi-AZ with Read Replicas
4. **Create S3 bucket** with lifecycle policy and versioning
5. **Build serverless API** with API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB
6. **Set up CloudWatch** alarms and dashboards
7. **Configure IAM** users, groups, roles, and policies
8. **Create CloudFront** distribution with S3 origin
9. **Design Route 53** with multiple routing policies
