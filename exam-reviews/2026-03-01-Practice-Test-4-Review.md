## ❌ Incorrect Questions - Detailed Review
   - Storage lifecycle policies
   - Cost allocation and billing

---

## ❌ Incorrect Questions Analysis

### Question 7: Auto Scaling Metrics ❌
**Topic:** Design Resilient Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Network Out  
**Correct Answer:** Memory Utilization  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Memory Utilization is NOT a predefined metric for Auto Scaling target tracking
- Requires CloudWatch agent to publish custom metrics
- All other options (CPU, Network In/Out) are predefined

**Key Takeaway:**
> 🔑 **EC2 does not publish memory metrics by default. You must install CloudWatch agent for memory-based scaling.**

---

### Question 13: Redshift Snapshot Costs ❌
**Topic:** Design Cost-Optimized Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Increase automated snapshot retention to 35 days  
**Correct Answer:** Delete unneeded manual snapshots  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Manual snapshots persist until explicitly deleted and incur storage charges
- Increasing retention INCREASES cost, not reduces it
- Should audit and delete old manual snapshots first

**Key Takeaway:**
> 💰 **Manual Redshift snapshots are retained indefinitely. Always clean up old manual backups to reduce costs.**

---

### Question 17: S3 Glacier Retrieval ❌
**Topic:** Design Cost-Optimized Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Expedited  
**Correct Answer:** Standard  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Expedited (1-5 min) is faster but more expensive
- Standard (3-5 hours) meets the requirement and is cost-effective
- Bulk (5-12 hours) is too slow

**Key Takeaway:**
> ⏱️ **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval tiers: Expedited (1-5min, $$), Standard (3-5hr, $), Bulk (5-12hr, ¢)**

---

### Question 18: Backend Security Group ❌
**Topic:** Design Resilient Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Use the launch configuration as the source  
**Correct Answer:** Use the frontend security group ID as the source  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Security group rules accept other SG IDs as sources
- Launch configurations cannot be used in SG rules
- SG-to-SG references automatically handle IP changes

**Key Takeaway:**
> 🔒 **Security groups can reference other security groups. This provides automatic, scalable access control.**

---

### Question 19: Multi-Tier Savings Plans ❌
**Topic:** Design Cost-Optimized Architectures  
**Your Answer:** EC2 Instance SP for web; Compute SP for app and DB  
**Correct Answer:** Compute SP for web; EC2 Instance SP for app; RDS RI for DB  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Web tier (varied families) needs Compute Savings Plan flexibility
- App tier (stable family) benefits from higher EC2 Instance SP discount
- RDS requires its own Reserved Instances, not covered by EC2 SPs

**Key Takeaway:**
> 💡 **Compute SP = flexibility; EC2 Instance SP = highest discount; RDS = separate RIs**

---

### Question 25: CloudTrail Log Integrity ❌
**Topic:** Design Secure Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Use SSE-KMS encryption for the CloudTrail logs  
**Correct Answer:** Enable CloudTrail log file integrity validation  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Encryption protects confidentiality, not integrity
- Log file integrity validation uses SHA-256 hashes + digital signatures
- Provides cryptographic proof logs weren't tampered with

**Key Takeaway:**
> 🔐 **CloudTrail log file integrity validation = tamper detection. Encryption = confidentiality.**

---

### Question 28: Auto Scaling Lifecycle ❌
**Topic:** Design High-Performing Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Customize the termination policy to copy data  
**Correct Answer:** Add lifecycle hooks to the Auto Scaling group  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Termination policies decide WHICH instance to terminate
- Lifecycle hooks allow custom actions BEFORE termination
- Hooks provide wait state for cleanup scripts/data copy

**Key Takeaway:**
> ⏸️ **Lifecycle hooks = pause before termination. Termination policies = choose which instance.**

---

### Question 34: Mixed Instance Auto Scaling ❌
**Topic:** Design Cost-Optimized Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Use all t2.micro On-Demand instances  
**Correct Answer:** Use mixed instances policy: On-Demand base = 2; above that 20% On-Demand / 80% Spot  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Downgrading to t2.micro may hurt performance
- Mixed instances policy balances cost and reliability
- Keep base capacity On-Demand, use Spot for burst

**Key Takeaway:**
> 🎯 **Mixed instances policy: stable base (On-Demand) + cost-effective burst (Spot)**

---

### Question 36: CloudFormation Drift Detection ❌
**Topic:** Design High-Performing Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Grant additional Read permissions to drift detection  
**Correct Answer:** Explicitly set the property values in the template  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Drift detection only tracks explicitly declared properties
- Default values are not monitored
- Must declare all properties to detect drift

**Key Takeaway:**
> 📝 **CloudFormation drift detection: if not in template, it's not tracked. Declare defaults explicitly.**

---

### Question 38: Multi-Account ALB Access ❌
**Topic:** Design High-Performing Architectures  
**Your Answer:** B and D (missing C)  
**Correct Answer:** B and C  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Both inbound rule for parent objects AND disabling Block Public Access are needed
- Missed the critical step of allowing public reads via bucket policy

**Key Takeaway:**
> 🌐 **S3 public website: (1) Disable Block Public Access + (2) Bucket policy for public reads**

---

### Question 45: Session Storage ❌
**Topic:** Design High-Performing Architectures  
**Your Answer:** C and D (ELB + ElastiCache)  
**Correct Answer:** B and D (DynamoDB + ElastiCache)  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- ELB does not store session data, only provides sticky sessions
- DynamoDB is a proper session store with TTL support
- ElastiCache is correct for in-memory caching

**Key Takeaway:**
> 💾 **Session stores: DynamoDB (durable, TTL) + ElastiCache (fast, in-memory)**

---

### Question 48: ALB Access Logging ❌
**Topic:** Design Secure Architectures  
**Your Answer:** AWS CloudTrail data events for the ALB  
**Correct Answer:** ALB access logs to Amazon S3  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- CloudTrail logs control plane API calls, not data plane requests
- ALB access logs record every request with client IP details
- Access logs are designed for forensics and compliance

**Key Takeaway:**
> 📊 **CloudTrail = control plane (API calls). ALB access logs = data plane (requests).**

---

### Question 56: EBS Cross-Region ❌
**Topic:** Design Resilient Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Enable Amazon S3 CRR on the snapshot storage bucket  
**Correct Answer:** Copy the EBS snapshot from us-east-1 to ap-south-1  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Snapshots are stored in AWS-managed S3, you can't configure CRR
- Must use built-in snapshot copy feature
- Can copy across regions with optional encryption changes

**Key Takeaway:**
> 📸 **EBS snapshots: use snapshot copy API, not S3 replication**

---

### Question 58: Restore S3 Versioned Object ❌
**Topic:** Design Resilient Architectures  
**Your Answer:** Option D (partial understanding)  
**Correct Answer:** Delete the delete marker  

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Deleting with versioning creates a delete marker
- Must remove the delete marker to restore visibility
- Simply retrieving version ID doesn't restore normal access

**Key Takeaway:**
> 🗑️ **S3 versioning: delete = add marker. Restore = delete the marker.**
