## ❌ Incorrect Questions - Detailed Review

### 1. Question 4: S3 Glacier to Intelligent-Tiering Migration
**Domain:** Design Cost-Optimized Architectures  
**Status:** ❌ Incorrect (Marked for Review)

**Question Summary:**
A media company wants to move archived videos from S3 Glacier Deep Archive to S3 Intelligent-Tiering for re-use.

**Your Answer:**
- Change the bucket's default storage class to Intelligent-Tiering so existing objects are automatically migrated

**Correct Answer:**
- Restore objects from Glacier Deep Archive in the S3 console, copy them into Intelligent-Tiering while the temporary restore is active, then delete old archived versions

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Changing bucket default storage class only affects NEW uploads, not existing objects
- Glacier Deep Archive objects cannot be directly copied without restoration first

**Key Learning Points:**
- ⚠️ S3 Glacier restoration is required before changing storage class
- ⚠️ Bucket default storage class ≠ existing object migration
- ⚠️ Restore → Copy → Delete workflow for Glacier objects

**Study Resources:**
- [Module 04: Storage - S3 Storage Classes](../04-Storage/README.md)
- [AWS Docs: Restoring Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/restoring-objects.html)

**Status:** ❌ Incorrect (Marked for Review)

**Question Summary:**
A transcription platform needs highly durable, scalable storage for audio files and transcripts with frequent access.

**Your Answer:**
- Archive files in S3 Glacier vault to minimize storage cost

**Correct Answer:**
- Store audio and text files as objects in an Amazon S3 bucket

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Glacier is for infrequent access/archival, not frequent access
- Requirement stated "frequently access" - Glacier has retrieval delays

**Key Learning Points:**
- 🎯 S3 Standard = frequent access, high durability
- 🎯 S3 Glacier = archival, infrequent access, retrieval delays
- 🎯 Read requirements carefully: "frequent access" keyword

**Study Resources:**
- [Module 04: Storage - S3 Storage Classes Decision](../04-Storage/README.md)

---

### 5. Question 16: Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations
**Domain:** Design Secure Architectures  
**Status:** ❌ Incorrect

**Question Summary:**
Project_OU denies ec2:DeleteFlowLogs, but Dev_OU (child) allows it. Can users delete flow logs?

**Your Answer:**
- Yes. The allow statement in Dev_OU grants permission even if parent OU denies

**Correct Answer:**
- No. Explicit deny in Project_OU applies to all child OUs and cannot be overridden

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Forgot the fundamental SCP rule: **Explicit DENY always wins**
- Parent OU deny cannot be overridden by child OU allow

**Key Learning Points:**
- ⚠️ SCPs: Explicit DENY > Allow (always)
- ⚠️ Parent OU policies apply to ALL child OUs
- ⚠️ SCPs define maximum permissions, not grant them

**Your Answer:**
- Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)
- Amazon CloudWatch

**Correct Answer:**
- Amazon CloudWatch
- Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Selected SES instead of SNS for CloudWatch alarm notifications
- SES = transactional emails, not alarm notifications
- SNS = pub/sub notification service, integrates directly with CloudWatch alarms

**Key Learning Points:**
- 📧 CloudWatch Alarms → SNS → Email/SMS/Lambda
- 📧 SES = bulk/transactional emails, not monitoring
- 📧 SNS = notification service for alarms and events

**Study Resources:**
- [Module 09: Monitoring - CloudWatch Alarms](../09-Monitoring/README.md)
- [AWS Docs: SNS with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome-features.html)

**Your Answer:**
- Enable enhanced networking with Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)

**Correct Answer:**
- Use Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) on supported EC2 instances

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- ENA = enhanced networking but not HPC-optimized
- EFA = specialized for HPC with OS-bypass capabilities

**Key Learning Points:**
- 🚀 EFA = HPC workloads, ultra-low latency, OS-bypass, MPI support
- 🚀 ENA = general enhanced networking, good but not HPC-specific
- 🚀 HPC keyword → think EFA

**Study Resources:**
- [Module 03: Compute - HPC and Networking](../03-Compute/README.md)

**Your Answer:**
- Memory utilization of the ECS container tasks

**Correct Answer:**
- The number of visible messages in the SQS queue

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Memory utilization = resource-based, not workload-based
- SQS queue depth = direct indicator of pending work

**Key Learning Points:**
- 📊 SQS queue depth (ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible) = best metric for queue-based scaling
- 📊 Memory/CPU = resource metrics, not workload indicators
- 📊 Scale based on work pending, not resource consumption

**Study Resources:**
- [Module 08: Application Integration - SQS Scaling Patterns](../08-Application-Integration/README.md)
- [AWS Docs: Auto Scaling with SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html)

- ❌ (Missing) Amazon RDS creates storage volume snapshot once per day. Transaction logs uploaded to S3 every 5 minutes
- ✅ Amazon RDS automated backups allow PITR by combining daily snapshot with continuous transaction logs
- ✅ (Incorrect selection) You must manually enable transaction log backups for PITR

**Correct Answers:**
- ✅ Daily snapshot + transaction logs every 5 minutes
- ✅ PITR combines snapshot + transaction logs
- ❌ Transaction logs are AUTOMATIC, not manual

**Why You Got It Wrong:**
- Didn't select the snapshot frequency answer
- Incorrectly thought transaction logs needed manual enablement

**Key Learning Points:**
- 💾 RDS Automated Backups = Daily snapshot + transaction logs every 5 minutes
- 💾 PITR = Snapshot + transaction logs (automatic)
- 💾 No manual intervention needed for transaction logs

**Study Resources:**
- [Module 05: Database - RDS Backups](../05-Database/README.md)
- [AWS Docs: RDS Automated Backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html)
